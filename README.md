|What is a Quick sort|[quick sort algorithm](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WprjBK0p6rw)|

## Problem

Analyze the elements {19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 3, 0} using the `Selection Sort` and `Quick Sort` algorithms.

### Implementation
* Implement the elements {19, 16, 13, 10, 7, 3, 0} using the `Selection Sort` and `Quick Sort` algorithms with the **minimum number** of 
 steps.
[Selection sort](https://csvistool.com/SelectionSort) and [Quick sort](https://csvistool.com/Quicksort).
* What are the **key** differences between the `Selection sort` and `Quick sort` algorithms?
